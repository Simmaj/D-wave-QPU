# 🧠 Quantum Programming Core – D-Wave

Welcome to my repository of hands-on quantum computing assignments completed as part of the **Quantum Programming Core** course by **D-Wave**. 
This repo showcases my work with **hybrid quantum-classical solvers**, QUBO modeling, and real-world optimization problems using the D-Wave Ocean SDK and Leap platform.

---

## 📚 Course Overview

The Quantum Programming Core course focuses on:

- Formulating optimization problems as QUBOs (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization)
- Applying classical and quantum-enhanced solvers
- Working with tools like Ocean SDK, `dimod`, and `dwave-networkx`
- Solving problems such as the Traveling Salesperson Problem, scheduling, constraint satisfaction, and more

## 📁 Repo Structure

Each folder in this repo contains one complete assignment from the course:

### `tsp/` – Traveling Salesperson Problem
- 📄 `hss_exercise.py`: Solves the TSP using D-Wave’s **Hybrid Solver Service (HSS)**
- 📄 `compare_solver_exercise.py`: Solves the same problem using a **classical simulated annealing** solver
- 🔍 **Description**: This assignment compares the effectiveness of hybrid quantum-classical solving vs classical heuristics on a fully connected TSP.It explores route validity, QUBO constraints, and the use of Lagrange multipliers to enforce legal tours.
